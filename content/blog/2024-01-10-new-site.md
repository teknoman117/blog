Trying out this thing called Zola. Bumped into it as it's the same engine used by the [blog_os](https://os.phil-opp.com/) website. 

Sort-of migrated the interesting posts from the old site to the new one. The [Old Blog](https://nathanielrlewis.com) will be going down permanently at the end of January.
